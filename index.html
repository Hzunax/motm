						Well, after discussing with our Talent Development Manager, we've decided to go to a conference instead of a training.
						Being front-end developers, we decided to go to the CSS- and JS conference in Berlin, from the 1st until the 3rd of June.

						<h2>Browser support?</h2>
						<iframe id="grid-iframe" data-src="https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid"></iframe>
						<aside class="notes">
							As you can see, CSS grid is now supported in all major browsers (or at least partially supported).
							But this wasn't always the case. As many of you may know, it usually takes some time before browsers other than Chrome include the
							newest features.
							But does that mean you should wait to include those features in your projects?
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section data-background="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7btT1T9qpQZWhNlK/giphy.gif">
						<aside class="notes">
							Not necessarily. We are Exellysts, so we want to stay ahead of the crowd!
							Should we then exclude certain users because they are using an inferior browser? That's a definite no!
							Luckily, CSS provides a at-rule that you can use:
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>CSS @supports rule</h2>
						<div class="flex-container">
							<pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
								@supports (display: grid) {
								  div {
								    display: grid;
								  }
								}
							</code></pre>
							<div></div>
							<pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
								div {
								  display: flex;
								}
							</code></pre>
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							Using the @supports rule will check whether a browser supports that specific feature. If not, you can specify
							some fallback layout that will then be used in browsers that haven't included that feature.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>But ...</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							What if @supports is not supported?
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<!-- TODO add slide -->
						<aside class="notes">
							Well luckily, if the browser doesn't recognize the @supports rule, it will not even try to interpret it at all. It will simply
							discard the entire rule and move on to the next. Since you have defined some fallback content, it will take that as the
							styling.

							One of these guidelines says that the contrast ratio of text and images of text has to be at least 4.5:1 (3:1 for large text).
							How is this ratio calculated?
							Well, every color has a relative luminance. This value ranges from 0 for black, to 1 for white.

								- Delivery service (pizza, package, ...)
								- Event updates (festival, conference, ...) so you don't always have to check their social media for updates.

						<h2><span class="accentuate">Timely</span>, <span class="accentuate">Actionable</span> and <span class="accentuate">Personal</span></h2>

						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Actionable</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							The notification shouldn't just be a message. If I receive a notification that I can check in for my flight now, I want to be able to click the 
							notification and go to the check in procedure.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Personal</h2>

						<p class="fragment"><span class="accentuate">Your</span> pizza has arrived</p>

					<section>
						<h2>Allow users to <span class="accentuate">opt out</span></h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							You don't HAVE to make the notifications timely, actionable and personal. But if you don't, make sure the user can opt out from
							WITHIN your application, so they don't turn it off for all web apps!
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>If users block <span class="accentuate">all notifications</span>, the whole web suffers</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							Because if too many websites keep request permissions to send notifications without context, a user is just one click away of 
							blocking ALL notifications.

								We are both front end developers at ING, working with the same Javascript library: Polymer. 
								Polymer's aim is to make the life of developers easier when creating Progressive Web Apps 
								with Web Components, service workers & HTTP/2. 
								In our first months at our job, we did a 4 days training in this technology. 
								This was very interesting and really went in to the details of the framework. 
								But a couple of months later, we decided to do something else. This time, 
								not a training, but a conference. Our goal was to explore different options for 
								our open program and afterwards see which of both suits us the best, trainings or conferences.

							<h2>Networking !important</h2>
							<aside class="notes">
									We enjoyed the conference a lot. The atmosphere was good, everyone was very kind 
									and open for conversation. Networking is a big part of conferences. 
									Every kind of social media is used to enlarge networks. 
									And that is what we also tried to do, network as much as possible. 
									It is also nice that after the conference, you can still see updates 
									of those people on their twitter accounts and learn even more new things.

						</section>
						<section>
							<h2>Presentation1 !== Presentation2</h2>
							<aside class="notes">
								The presentations on the conference itself can differ a lot. 
								Some subjects can be very interesting for you and others maybe cover a thing 
								that you do not really want to learn more about. Often, there are multiple 
								presentations at the same moment, so normally, you can choose which one suits you the best. 
								Besides that, the quality of the presentations also depends on the presentation skills 
								of the person in front itself. Those persons have some experience in it, but still, 
								not everyone is used to talk in front of a big audience, especially not when that 
								audience exists out of sceptical developers.
							</aside>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h2>training.value > conference.value</h2>
							<h2>||</h2>
							<h2>training.value < conference.value</h2>
							<aside class="notes">
								So, while we're not claiming trainings should be skipped and conferences are the way to go, 
								we do believe that combining both can add a lot of value to your profile.
								We have done both now, and we can see advantages and disadvantages in both of them. 
								Trainings are very concrete, they go much more in to detail and will help you in mastering 
								a quality in a short period of time. But on the other hand, in a rapidly changing world 
								like the programming community, trainings sometimes fail to stay up to date. 
								Most conferences won’t always provide that much information about one specific topic, 
								but will help you in making the bigger picture and trigger you with the newest cool features.
