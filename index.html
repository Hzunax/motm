							<p class="steven">Not necessarily. We are Exellysts, so we want to stay ahead of the crowd!
							Should we then exclude certain users because they are using an inferior browser? That's a definite no!
							Luckily, CSS provides a at-rule that you can use:</p>

						<h2>CSS @supports rule</h2>

								}
							</code></pre>
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p class="steven">Using the @supports rule will check whether a browser supports that specific feature. If not, you can specify
							some fallback layout that will then be used in browsers that haven't included that feature.</p>

							Well luckily, if the browser doesn't recognize the @supports rule, it will not even try to interpret it at all. It will simply
							discard the entire rule and move on to the next. Since you have defined some fallback content, it will take that as the
							styling.

							been fulfilled or rejected.

								The presentations on the conference itself can differ a lot.

								presentations at the same moment, so normally, you can choose which one suits you the best. 
								Besides that, the quality of the presentations also depends on the presentation skills 
								of the person in front itself. Those persons have some experience in it, but still, 
								not everyone is used to talk in front of a big audience, especially not when that 
								audience exists out of sceptical developers.

								So, while we're not claiming trainings should be skipped and conferences are the way to go,

								Trainings are very concrete, they go much more in to detail and will help you in mastering 
								a quality in a short period of time. But on the other hand, in a rapidly changing world 
								like the programming community, trainings sometimes fail to stay up to date. 
								Most conferences won’t always provide that much information about one specific topic,

							Our presentation is almost over, so it's time for a quick recap.
							We went very fast over a couple of subjects of the conference, if you want to know more about
							these or want to find out about the other talks, all of the presentations will end up on YouTube.
							In a couple of weeks, we will also publish a blog post with the presentations we liked the most.
							</p>
							<p class="steven">
							Also, we want to let you guys consider about attending a conference. Have a chat with your TDM
							about it if you are interested, and keep on learning!

							Ow yeah, and last but not least; if you attend one, don't forget to enjoy!
